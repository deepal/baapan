# Baapan

**Baapan brings the all of the NPM goodness right into your REPL. On-demand!!.**

Using Node REPL for quick local testing is a common practice among JavaScript/Node developers. But the problem with the REPL is, you don't have the luxury to take advantage of the entire NPM ecosystem out-of-the-box. 

If you feel you need an NPM module to quickly test something (e.g, `lodash` to do some quick object/array manipulation, `uuid` to quickly generate some uuid), you'll have to exit the REPL, install the module locally and load it onto the REPL. 

**Baapan** is a replacement for `require()` in node REPL. If the module you need is not installed locally, it will immediately grab it from NPM and load it to the console. Effortless âœ¨ðŸ˜Ž!!

### How?

#### Step 1: Install baapan

```sh
npm install baapan
```
#### Step 2: Load baapan with REPL

```sh
node --require baapan --experimental-repl-await
```
**Important!!** Baapan relies on `async-await` in REPL, therefore you need to enable the use of `async-await` in REPL using `--experimental-repl-await` flag.


#### Step 3: Use `await baapan()` instead of `require`

```
> const lodash = await baapan('lodash')
+ lodash@4.17.11
updated 1 package and audited 24204 packages in 2.501s
found 0 vulnerabilities

> lodash.concat([1], 2, [3,4])
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

Baapan will immediately download the module via `npm` and `require` it so that it's available on the REPL!!!!

**You can also `require` a submodule with `baapan()`. See the following:**

------------------

**If you feel lazy to type the entire command everytime you need to start the REPL, just go ahead and add an alias for the command in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.**

For `~/.bashrc`

```
$ echo "alias nodeb='node --require baapan --experimental-repl-await'" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

For `~/.bash_profile`

```
$ echo "alias nodeb='node --require baapan --experimental-repl-await'" >> ~/. bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
